SURVIVAL DIFFICULTY:

2?

- Mostly Safe.
- Fairly Secure.
- Minimal Entity Count.

![A crumbling castle, sitting upon a grassy hill underneath blue storm clouds.](https://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-28/stormstone-keep.png)

Stormstone Keep, the only remaining building on Level 28.

Level 28, also known as "Final Virtue," consists primarily of windswept grasslands under a perpetually overcast sky. Despite this, it has never been observed to rain on this level. The sky is also devoid of both a sun and a moon; instead, the level is illuminated by a faint blue glow.

**I should have known what she was going to do. I should have stopped her. We could have destroyed it together. But Hope always prioritized everyone else's safety over her own. I thought the conversation we had last night would at least convince her to wait longer. If she had just *waited* until this morning, I could have told the others. I know she would have listened to all of us.**

**But instead, she went on her own, cleaving the flaming eye, and disappearing along with it.**

[- Close Recovered File-28A](javascript:;)

The safest region of the level spans roughly 13.5 kilometers (8.4 miles) across. Beyond this central zone, within the surrounding mountains, lies an encroaching darkness resembling a viscous, tar-like material, which appears to be slowly advancing toward the center of the level.

# **Level Anomalies**

- [*The Living Abyss*](javascript:;)
- [*Stormstone Circle*](javascript:;)
- [*Periodic Lightning*](javascript:;)

![A dark lake of tar nested between multiple mountains.](https://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-28/28-tar.jpg)

A distant Abyss Pool advancing from the mountain.

As previously described, the safest area of this level is surrounded on all sides by an ever-encroaching black tar-like material colloquially referred to as "The Living Abyss." The Abyss exhibits certain traits resembling sentience, the most relevant being signs of self-preservation and adaptive behavior. When any portion of it is isolated or destroyed, it'll temporarily retreat only to return later, having "learned." Any learned behaviors are typically short-term and will decay within a few cycles.

Anything that actively comes into contact with the abyss is slowly contaminated by its corruption, progressing in 3 stages of visible change. At **Stage 1**, it begins by targeting the mind, causing individuals to lose most, if not all, of their memories. Memories are gradually lost in chunks, beginning with older memories, such as those from childhood, and progressing until the infected lose their sense of identity. At this stage, the corruption is only temporary, and its reversal can be hastened by ingesting [Almond Water](object-1.md).

If an infected individual remains in contact with the abyss for 8 more hours, they will enter **Stage 2**. In stage 2, the infected wanderer's veins will enlarge and become significantly darker. At this stage, wanderers typically experience a high fever and become unresponsive. Almond Water no longer works as a cure, and separation from the abyss will not reverse its progression.

After 3-4 more hours of contact, the infection will progress to **Stage 3**. The infected individual will begin to disintegrate gradually. Starting from their fingers, every piece of them will begin to turn into ash-like particles that begin to shrink out of existence.

![4 standing stones in a grassy field, taking a roughly circular appearance. The left-most stone is broken, and a chunk of it lies nearby. More Stones are implied to be out of frame.](https://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-28/28-graves.jpg)

A picture of ST-3 before it undergoes reconstruction.

Located approximately 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) from the keep is a megalithic structure that has been nicknamed "Stormstone Circle." This structure consists of exactly 6 [standing stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menhir), arranged in a circular formation. Each stone is inscribed with 1 rune and a short description. The runes are not a part of any known language and have yet to be deciphered.

When damaged significantly, the stones are known to undergo a process of reconstruction in which they return to a more stable state. This process has yet to be observed directly. However, it is important to note that the stones do not revert to their original state and will often still be missing pieces lost from weathering or minor destruction.

For convenience, each stone and its descriptor are listed below.

ST-1: **Prudence** - A curse  
ST-2: **Hope** - A clear sky  
ST-3: **Faith** - An eternal home  
ST-4: **Fortitude** - A blazing force  
ST-5: **Justice** - An endless storm  
ST-6: **Charity** - [Indecipherable]

![A single Lightning strike descending from a dark blue cloud onto a distant plain.](https://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-28/28-Lightning.jpg)

A lightning strike during the 25th hour at the 4th impact site.

Lightning strikes on Level 28 occur at regular intervals, rotating through 7 localized zones evenly distributed around the perimeter of the level's safest area. Time-keeping devices within Level 28 have recorded each strike as being exactly an hour apart. This makes timekeeping straightforward; 24 strikes correspond to what residents experience as a full day.

However, time-keeping devices outside of the level have recorded each strike being roughly 51 minutes apart, meaning 28 strikes (4 cycles through all 7 zones) would be required to complete a full 24-hour cycle. This discrepancy indicates that time dilation occurs on Level 28.

The Living Abyss inhabiting this level is known to be afraid of the strikes and will intentionally avoid these areas completely. It can occasionally be observed recoiling from the impact sites during strikes.

**It's just Charity and me now. Temperance and Charity. We've already lost so much. I thought that maybe the 3 of us could continue to survive. I was naive.**

**The worst part is, when I try to think back to that moment, it's just a blur. I was so focused on trying to save Justice from the abyss. I was so consumed with concern. That I didn't even get to witness the moment she took her life. She had plunged her own spear into her heart. It wasn't until that first flash of light that I realized I had failed to save her.**

**It's been 2 days now, and Charity still hasn't recovered. She seems so shaken up that she won't even talk to me about her favorite places to sit or a new constellation she saw. Instead, she just sits and reads. I'm afraid that maybe she blames me for Justice's death. That if I had just acted faster and been more focused, I could have saved her. But I didn't, and each flash is a stinging pain burned into my soul.**

# **Stormstone Keep**

Stormstone Keep, also known colloquially as just "The Keep," is a dilapidated European-style medieval castle, located roughly in the center of the safe zone. The interior of the keep is the only area not bathed in a permanent blue glow, instead lit from normal lamps and ceiling lights. The interior's design is reminiscent of classic medieval designs with a bizarre mix of modern appliances and amenities. On the second floor, there are 7 guest bedrooms and 1 bedchamber belonging to the Blue Knight. Located in the basement is a forge with weapons such as swords, maces, spears, and other malformed metals strewn across the ground.

**It's been at least 8 days now, and the storm hasn't stopped. The combination of wind and rain was a torrent hellbent on destroying our home. It was obvious that we had to take action. Faith was the only one who had a plan. He heard of a relic, something powerful enough to protect the entire keep from harm. He left with Fortitude to find it.**

**But when the doors opened again, Fortitude was the only one there. Barely able to stand,  
rainwater dripping from every piece of his armor, and in his hands a glowing green tesseract.**

**The keep is safe now. But was it worth the cost? Three empty rooms. Three endings. Unable to move forward. Jokes I'll never get to hear again, books I won't be recommended, memories we won't get to make.**

**And I can't help but think about those of us who remain. Will I wake tomorrow only to find another one gone? Will I one day also have to give my life to protect those who remain? Will I have the strength to sacrifice myself for the greater good?**

# **Entities**

Level 28 is almost entirely devoid of entities. Common entities that no-clip in from other levels, such as smilers, hounds, and skin stealers, are known to immediately disintegrate upon entry. While rarer and often level-specific entities are no-clipped back to their natural habitats.

**Our leader is dead. He transmuted his soul into what he called a "sterilization curse." He said it would get rid of the monsters plaguing us, and it did. But was it worth it? We didn't just lose a leader; we lost our sense of direction.**

**Fortitude and Justice haven't always been the kindest to each other, but now? It feels like every conversation turns into an argument about Prudence's decision, whether it was noble or reckless, or part of some larger plan we didn't know. It's exhausting.**

**Not long before, we were a well-oiled machine. But now it feels like every gear is grinding against the others. Prudence was wise, wiser than any of us, to a degree I still don't understand. Part of me keeps holding on to the idea that he could foresee all of this happening. And that he wouldn't have made that sacrifice if he thought it'd break us apart for good.**

**The truth is, I don't know what he was thinking in his final moments. But he must've seen a future where we all made it through. I have to believe that.**

The only entity confirmed to reside on this level is the Blue Knight, a large, hollow suit of armor. According to reports, he identifies as male and has been known to refer to himself with the name "Temperance," although irregularly. Although intimidating in his appearance, the Blue Knight has not exhibited any signs of hostility and is generally willing to assist wanderers. However, Temperance is known to become attached to those he believes are his friends and may be reluctant to share information about exits. Wanderers are advised to remain emotionally distant if planning to depart.

Attached to this page are transcriptions of The Knight's journal, recovered from photographs.

**I don't know what to do anymore. How am I supposed to continue on my own?**

**Charity has fallen ill. I don't know how or why, but she has. I've tried everything I could think of, but her condition just appears to be getting worse. I feel so powerless. Headache, fever, delirium. Every symptom worse than the last. At first, I thought it was temporary. But it's quickly becoming clear that it's going to take a miracle to save her. A miracle, I fear, won't come to pass.**

**Is this the way things were meant to be? Everyone's death, leaving me alone. Why is Temperance left behind? Was this the outcome Prudence wanted, every knight fallen, with me as the final virtue? The Blue Knight, alone to face the void infecting this land. Unless… I am also fated to end.**

**Her precious voice, the one I hadn't heard in months, now strained and weak, called out to me. She told me that it wasn't my fault. That she trusts me. I broke down when she said it. I hadn't realized how much I was holding in, and it all came flooding out. She held my hand as I let it all out. It was all so overwhelming that I didn't notice Charity's grip loosen until it was too late.**

**Empty. This land is empty. This keep is empty. I am empty. 6 Deaths. Deaths I couldn't prevent. No matter what I tried. If I can't even save my friends, how am I supposed to save our home?**

**I don't deserve to be here. That is why I must fight for this land's existence. They died to protect this place. So I must live to fulfill their wishes.**

Continued observation of the Blue Knight reveals that he routinely patrols the perimeter of the safe zone and actively engages with the Abyss when it encroaches. Although the mechanism behind it is not well understood, Temperance's sword is able to harm the abyss; tendrils struck by it shatter into particulates that eventually disintegrate. Consequently, surrounding portions of the substance will recoil back into nearby Abyss pools.

As of 5/8/2020, it is not recommended to attempt neutralization or removal of The Knight, as it is highly likely that this would result in the rapid advance of the abyss and subsequent deterioration of the level. It is currently unknown how long this equilibrium between The Knight and the abyss has been maintained.

**Sarah. Sarah was her name. I didn't know something like this was even possible.**

**I found her near the graves, writing something down. At first, I thought I had begun to hallucinate. But she seemed so real, I wanted nothing more than to reach out. So I began to approach; however, as soon as she spotted me, she ran.**

**She didn't run far. And I could still see her watching me from a distance. I didn't want to scare her any more than I already did, so I retreated into the keep. I told myself not to get my hopes up, but I stayed near the door, just in case.**

**Hours later, she was knocking on the door. It's been so long since I've heard that sound. I couldn't help myself; without a plan, I immediately opened the door. She was shivering, so I immediately tried to invite her in. It took some convincing, but eventually she decided to trust me.**

**I don't remember how exactly we began to talk to each other, but that was possibly the happiest I've ever been. She taught me a lot about the truth of this reality, about the different "levels," about her home. It's still difficult to grasp the vastness of this place, The Backrooms. I would love to see these other places, but I can't. I can't abandon everyone.**

**We became so close in those few days. It was incredible even just talking to her. I didn't share everything, though. Some things are too painful to think about. And our conversations were the perfect distraction.**

**Of course, this didn't last forever. As her rations began to dwindle, one question became more and more common. An exit. At first, I feigned ignorance. When that didn't work, I tried to distract her with gifts. But she saw through the flowers and trinkets. As much as I didn't want this to end, it would be worse to end it on such a sour note. So I told her what I knew. I still don't know if it was exactly what she wanted, but she's gone now.**

**It hurt all over again, to be alone. To yet again have any connection ripped from me. And so I continue my mission. Just the same as before. Everything feels so much quieter now.**
